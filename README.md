# Light Sensor with Arduino

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Uno with a light sensor to control an LED based on the ambient light intensity. When the ambient light level exceeds a certain threshold, the LED turns on, and when the light level decreases below the threshold, the LED turns off.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Uno**
2. **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) or Photoresistor**
3. **10kŒ© Resistor**
4. **LED**
5. **220Œ© Resistor**
6. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram


#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect one leg of the LDR to the 5V pin on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the other leg of the LDR to the analog pin A0.
   - Connect a 10kŒ© resistor from the junction of the LDR and the analog pin to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the positive (longer leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino Uno via a 220Œ© current-limiting resistor.
   - Connect the negative (shorter leg) of the LED to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino Uno.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 in the `setup()` function.

3. **Light Sensing and LED Control:**
   - Read the analog value from the light sensor using the `analogRead()` function.
   - Print the sensor value to the Serial Monitor for monitoring.
   - Use an `if` statement to compare the sensor value with a threshold (e.g., 500).
   - If the sensor value is above the threshold, turn on the LED by setting the corresponding pin to `HIGH`.
   - If the sensor value is below the threshold, turn off the LED by setting the corresponding pin to `LOW`.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno and open the Serial Monitor.
   - Observe the sensor value displayed on the Serial Monitor.
   - Shine light onto the LDR to observe the LED turning on when the ambient light exceeds the threshold.

5. **Adjustments:**
   - Adjust the threshold value in the code to suit the ambient light conditions and sensitivity requirements.
   - Experiment with different resistor values in the voltage divider circuit to adjust the sensitivity of the light sensor.

#### Applications

- **Automatic Lighting Systems:** Implement automatic lighting systems that adjust based on ambient light levels.
- **Security Systems:** Use light sensors to trigger security lights based on changes in light intensity.
- **Energy Conservation:** Control lighting in rooms to conserve energy based on natural light availability.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper orientation and connection of the LDR and LED to the Arduino Uno.
- Adjust the threshold value and resistor values to optimize the sensitivity and responsiveness of the light sensor.
