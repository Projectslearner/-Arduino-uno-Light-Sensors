# Arduino Uno Light Sensor (LDR)

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) with an Arduino Uno to measure light intensity. The analog value read from the LDR is displayed on the Arduino's serial monitor, providing a measure of ambient light levels.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)**
- **Resistors (if needed for LDR voltage divider)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect LDR to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect one leg of the LDR to 5V on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the other leg of the LDR to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Optionally, use a resistor to create a voltage divider for accurate readings.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Ensure the LDR is correctly connected to the Arduino Uno as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the light intensity values displayed, which correspond to the ambient light levels sensed by the LDR.

#### Applications

- **Environmental Monitoring:** Use for measuring light levels in indoor or outdoor environments.
- **Automation:** Implement in projects where light-dependent actions are required, such as automatic lighting systems.
- **Education:** Learn about analog sensors and interfacing with Arduino.

#### Notes

- Ensure the LDR is exposed to the ambient light conditions you intend to measure.
- Calibrate the system by adjusting the code or using additional circuit components as necessary.
- Experiment with different resistors for the voltage divider to optimize sensitivity and range of the LDR.
